### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sh0ckFR, welcome on my GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C2 payloads and related stuff.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the mysteries of the Active Directory after learning enough things to not be too bad at AV/EDR evasion.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can't really, just open an issue here: https://github.com/Sh0ckFR/Sh0ckFR

Thank you to my sponsors:

@michel-morin for 100$ (I really appreciate thank you!)
