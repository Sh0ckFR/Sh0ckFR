### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sh0ckFR, welcome on my GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C2 payloads and related stuff.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the mysteries of the Active Directory after learning enough things to not be too bad at AV/EDR evasion.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: via mail github[/at/]cyber-fr[-dot-]com (Do not contact me for illegal things please)

If you try to find my Twitter, it doesn't exists anymore because I decided to be far away from the social networks to focus myself on my projects so this is the only way to communicate with me.

By the way, I accept beers if you like my work ;)
