### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sh0ckFR, welcome on my GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C2 payloads and related stuff.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the mysteries of the Active Directory after learning enough things to not be too bad at AV/EDR evasion.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: via Twitter (Do not contact me for illegal things please)

Thank you to my sponsors:

@michel-morin for 100$ (I really appreciate, do not hesitate to contact me because I want to know who you are, probably a good guy IRL :D)
